## Yo!

I like building useful tools, especially if they can teach someone else about something I care about.

- 💪 I’m currently working on 'FDAPI: The Frame Data API', a resource containing Frame Data for competitive play in multiple fighting games, for beginners and veterans alike.
- 💻 I’m currently learning C# and a bit of Japanese.
- 💬 Ask me about FDAPI, let's colaborate!

  ...Did I say Python is cool? 😎
